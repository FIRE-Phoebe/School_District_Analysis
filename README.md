# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis 
School District Analysis project uses schools_complete and students_complete dataset to analyze schools' performance. By analyzing 15 schools in different districts, we use Pandas along with Jupyter Notebook to prepare our school analysis based on school funding, school size, overall passing rate, ect. It gives Distric School Board insight into how each school performs. However, we received new updates on student dataset. Our goal is to define these changes and analyze the impact on overall school analysis.

## Results 
### Define changes
We replace ninth graders' math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaN. After replacing the scores, we repeat the school district analysis. We focus on the following results:district summary and school summary.
